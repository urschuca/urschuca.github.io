To ensure that the system will reboot no matter what, I always do this sequence:

__# echo s > /proc/sysrq-trigger__<br>
__# echo u > /proc/sysrq-trigger__<br>
__# echo s > /proc/sysrq-trigger__<br>
__# echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger__<br>

This requests the kernel to do:

> emergency sync of the block devices<br>
> mount readonly of all filesystems<br>
> again a sync<br>
> force an immediate boot; you can also use o for poweroff.<br>

See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key) for explanation of this feature.
